# Serverless Application Model

![SAM Logo](/images/sam/sam-mascot.png)

The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework that developers use to build production-grade serverless applications on AWS.

A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks. But a serverless application is more than just a Lambda function—it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings.

In this chapter, you will learn how to quickly scaffold a SAM application and understand how it is structured.
